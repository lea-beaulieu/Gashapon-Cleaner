# Ready for the Gashapon Cleaner Challenge ? 

Hello world! 👋 
Gashapon Cleaner is the very first project since starting the 24-week Full Stack Web Developer training.  
All you have to do is help us sort our Gashapon Machine **by getting rid of the red Mario boxes** in 15 seconds. 


##  🎮 Demo

## 🧩 Introduction
#####

Requirement for this project was to create a **game** using the recent bases acquired in **JavaScript, HTML and CSS** within few days. 
**Responsive design was not a requirement**, but I will definitely work on it later on.

👉 Render a game in the browser, deployed online on Github Pages
👉 Include separate HTML / CSS/ JavaScript
👉 Logic of win or lose : get rid of all Mario's red boxes to win, if you do not suceed then you lose.


## 📝 Inspiration

Since the first project was all about having fun, the goal was to create an **easy, short and vivid game** that anybody could you try in few seconds. 
Inspiration came from a two-year experience in Japan 🇯🇵, and tried to recreate the Pachinko atmosphere, and its emblematic Gashapon vending machine. Particular attention was paid to the design of the game, I really enjoyed working on that part.
